\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
In the following section we list and describe the interfaces that will be provided by the software to external systems and users in order to access its functionalities. This includes user interface mockups as well as a definition of the APIs that will be realized for third party usage.

\subsubsection{User Interface}
A subset of the possible user interfaces that our platform offers to the customers is here provided. As always we divide the interfaces according to the system in examination:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Data4Help was designed to be mainly a web application. The structure of each page should be intuitive and user friendly, so that even the less experienced user in web browsing can easily use the system.
	The web interface is provided not only for the users, but also to third parties in order to better keep tracks or requests status and visualize data. A parallel API is also offered to third parties, which is described in later sections.
	\item AutomatedSOS and Track4Run are designed to be mobile applications. The following mockups show examples of the typical situations in which the user could find himself after installing the application and using it on his smart-phone. Hereunder mockups for other smart-devices are not included, but the user interfaces will be very similar to these ones. 
\end{itemize}

An example of UI mockups can be found here below.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
Since our system is designed to be a software platform running on any compatible hardware, no proprietary hardware interface is provided.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
The main external software interfaces of our system can be found in Data4Help, which as already explained is the part responsible of connecting data producers to data consumers.
To achieve this goal, Data4Help exposes two main software interfaces, which can be thought as APIs that are given to the third party applications in order to connect their software to ours.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Data Sharing Interface:} this interface can be used from third party organizations that want to access the user data contained in the system.
	The interface shall offer four main functionalities: authentication, group data requests, single data requests, subscription requests.
	
	Authentication must be done using a trustful way of identifying the organization that wants to register to the system, in order to prevent malicious actors to infiltrate the system. This can be for example an electronic signature connected with the VAT code of the company.
	
	Group data and single user data requests are defined by some filters that the third party wants to apply in order to retrieve only the needed data, and when this is possible they will generate a response containing the latest available data from the system.
	
	 Finally, subscription to new data can be performed by providing a callback interface, that will then be notified with some specific call whenever some new data is available on the system.
	 
	\item \textbf{Data Acquisition Interface:} this interface is provided to the applications and hardware devices that collect data from the user, and gives the possibility to add this kind of information to the user's data set in the system.
	
	As for third parties, authentication is necessary in this case too. This can be provided by the data source using the user's Data4Help credentials, so that the systems knows which user is adding that data source.
	
	Once authenticated, the data source is provided with an interface to send data streams to the Data4Help system, that will collect and store them safely. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
As communication interfaces, this system will use the commonly available protocols to access the internet and to make remote calls to software interfaces of external and internal systems.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
In general, the main performance requirements for our system concern the time needed to process data and fulfill data requests.

In particular, the system should meet the following strong requirement:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{AutomatedSOS Emergency Response}
	The system must call an ambulance within \textbf{5 seconds} from when a parameter exceeds a threshold. This time shall take into account the time needed for the AutomatedSOS monitoring system to process new incoming data and detect the emergency, the Data4Help system to send the new data to AutomatedSOS and the average delay introduced from the communication interfaces.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Constraints}
\subsubsection{Regulatory policies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{GDPR}: In order to protect the user's privacy and perform a correct data treatment, the system must be developed in compliance with the latest GDPR regulations, giving the maximum attention to the protection and anonymization of the user's data.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The only hardware limitations of our system is present in the devices on which AutomatedSOS and Track4Run applications will be installed. For this reason, the development of the software to be will have to reasonably take in account some common limitations of these devices, such as power consumption and memory size.


\subsection{Software System Attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}

The system must be available 24/7. Since this requirement is quite demanding, small service breaks will be tolerated. To boost reliability, a RAID architecture that combines multiple disk drives to have data redundancy is suggested. Using a RAID controller we could also expand disks' capacity or substitute them without the risk of losing data or suspending the service for too long. Preventive maintenance is also a good idea to avoid downtimes.

\subsubsection{Availability}

To guarantee a 3-nines (99.9\%) availability degree, a system of redundant servers could be considered. In this way we don't have a single point of failure and if one server fails, another one will be ready to substitute it.

\subsubsection{Security}

Security is a main issue.  At first, to access the functionalities offered by our platform, users have to complete a login phase providing their credentials: fiscal code and password in case of a single user or VAT code and electronic signature for the third parties. These sensitive information should be confidentially stored and encrypted using a proper hash function.

Secondly, the system  continuously collects data on health conditions from the users. Typically this kind of data are also considered sensitive and should be kept secret. Finally, also communications between users and our platform is very important, for this reason the system could be accessed by the customers using secure connection protocols like HTTPS to avoid Man In The Middle attacks. Only the system administrator who is responsible of the Web and Application Server configuration can decide if it is the case to implement them or not.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}

In order to make our software the most maintainable as possible, we will adopt a modular design for our code. In this different components of the system can be modified and additional ones can be introduced in the system with whenever is needed and with a minimal impact on the rest of the system.

Moreover, we will make sure to adopt standard design patterns and coding best practices, so that our code can be easily understood and modified by any future developer.

Finally, the code should be completely and properly documented in order to facilitate the understanding of it. 

\subsubsection{Portability}

During the system installation and setup, we have to consider different factors:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ease of installation on the central server
	\item Scalability of the platform considering future adjustments without losing the already collected data
	\item Portability of data between different machines, in order to move the system on several more powerful machines in case of necessity
	up 24/7
\end{itemize}
