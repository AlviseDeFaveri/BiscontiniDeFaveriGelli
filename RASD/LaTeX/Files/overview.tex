\subsection{Product perspective}
The main goal of this system is to collect registered users' data, make them available and offer monitoring services to the end user.

The system is designed to be a set of three subsystems interacting with each other. In particular, Data4Help is the undelying subsystem that collects data from end users and makes it available to third party applications. 
The other two subsystems are built on top of Data4Help and provide to the user different services: AutomatedSOS offers an automated way of calling an ambulance in case of emergency, while Track4Run gives to the end users a platform to organize and participate to run events.
