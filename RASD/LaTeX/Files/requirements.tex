\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
In the following section we list and describe the interfaces that will be provided by the software to external systems and users in order to access its functionalities. This includes user interface mockups as well as a definition of the APIs that will be realized for third party usage.

\subsubsection{User Interface}
A subset of the possible user interfaces that our platform offers to the customers is here provided. As always we divide the interfaces according to the system in examination:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Data4Help was designed to be mainly a web application. The structure of each page should be intuitive and user friendly, so that even the less experienced user in web browsing can easily use the system.
	\item AutomatedSOS and Track4Run are designed to be mobile applications. The following mockups show examples of the typical situations in which the user could find himself after installing the application and using it on his smart-phone. Hereunder mockups for other smart-devices are not included, but the user interfaces will be very similar to these ones. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
Since our system is designed to be a software platform running on any compatible hardware, no proprietary hardware interface is provided.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
The main external software interfaces of our system can be found in Data4Help, which as already explained is the part responsible of connecting data producers to data consumers.
To achieve this goal, Data4Help exposes two main software interfaces, which can be thought as APIs that are given to the third party applications in order to connect their software to ours.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Data Sharing Interface:} this interface can be used from third party organizations that want to access the user data contained in the system.
	The interface shall offer four main functionalities: authentication, group data requests, single data requests, subscription requests.
	
	Authentication must be done using a trustful way of identifying the organization that wants to register to the system, in order to prevent malicious actors to infiltrate the system. This can be for example an electronic signature connected with the VAT code of the company.
	
	Group data and single user data requests are defined by some filters that the third party wants to apply in order to retrieve only the needed data, and when this is possible they will generate a response containing the latest available data from the system.
	
	 Finally, subscription to new data can be performed by providing a callback interface, that will then be notified with some specific call whenever some new data is available on the system.
	 
	\item \textbf{Data Acquisition Interface:} this interface is provided to the applications and hardware devices that collect data from the user, and gives the possibility to add this kind of information to the user's data set in the system.
	
	As for third parties, authentication is necessary in this case too. This can be provided by the data source using the user's Data4Help credentials, so that the systems knows which user is adding that data source.
	
	Once authenticated, the data source is provided with an interface to send data streams to the Data4Help system, that will collect and store them safely. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
As communication interfaces, this system will use the commonly available protocols to access the internet and to make remote calls to software interfaces of external and internal systems.

 view of the application appears. Mary taps on the iClock icon and by selecting "Heart Rate" from a dropdown she assigns the tracking of that paramater to her smartwatch. With the same procedure, she assigns to her smartphone the tracking of the "Position" parameter.
Finally, she clicks on the "Confirm" button and the app saves the settings and returns back to the home page.
\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
Steve, a Data4Help customer with diabete, needs to periodically check the glucose levels observed by his medical device connected with the Data4Help application on his smartphone. For doing this, he starts the Data4Help application and when the homepage shows up he  clicks on the "myData" tab. A nice view appears, containing all the information about his monitored health parameters with a lot of colorful diagrams. Steve filters out the displayed content by selecting the "Glucose Level" radio button on the top of the page and he changes the information granularity from "Week" to "Day" using a dropdown.  
\subsubsection{Scenario 4}
Michael Garcia, Boyer Pharmaceutical CEO, heard about the Data4Help service and in agreement with the Administrative Board, he decided to introduce it in the company. He visits  www.trackme.com/data4help and clicks on the "Business Solutions" section in order to register his company as a registered third party of the service. To do this, Michael fills in the registration form with all the requested information about the company, including the VAT-number, an e-mail and a password. After that he clicks on the "Submit" button and he immediately receives an e-mail with a link to complete the registration procedure.
\subsubsection{Scenario 5}
Brian, patient of the Lenox Private Medical Center, was released  yesterday. The clinic, registered to the Data4Help service, decides to monitor his health status to see if the treatment he was under reached the desired results.
The doctor that was in charge of Brian logs in to the Data4Help reserved page of the clinic. Once logged in, he inserts Brian's fiscal code and selects from a checkbox "Heart Beat" and "Temperature" as the data to monitor. Finally he chooses from a dropdown "3 months" as the observation period.
As soon as the doctor clicks on the "Send Request" button on the bottom of the page, Brian receives a notification on his smartphone. He launches the application and when the home page shows up he taps on the "Incoming Requests" tab. Here he sees the request coming from Lenox Private Medical Center. He briefly reads the description and he clicks on the "Accept" button. A confirmation e-mail, saying the patient accepted the treatment of his personal data, is immediately sent to Lenox Private Medical Center.
The doctor sees the e-mail and goes in the "Sent Requests" section of the Data4Help personal page of the company. After clicking on Brian's answer, all the requested data are displayed on screen.
\subsubsection{Scenario 6}
Pfuzer, a big pharmaceutical company registered to Data4Help service, needs to gather the heart rate data of all the italian young people under 30 years old for a market analysis aimed at evaluating the production of a new drug against heart disease. For this reason Todd Chavez, the marketing manager of the company, goes to the Pfuzer personal Data4Help page and once logged  in he clicks on the "Aggregated requests" tab in the home page. Once in the page he types in the textbox "Italy" as location, and selects the age range "<= 30" using a slider. Then he clicks on "Send request" on the bottom of the page and a warning message is immediately displayed on screen saying that the request cannot be satisfied. For this reason, Todd decides to untighten the search parameters. After changing them the constraints are satisfied and the requested data is immediately displayed on screen.
\subsubsection{Scenario 7}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
In general, the main performance requirements for our system concern the time needed to process data and fulfill data requests.

In particular, the system should meet the following strong requirement:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{AutomatedSOS Emergency Response}
	The system must call an ambulance within \textbf{5 seconds} from when a parameter exceeds a threshold. This time shall take into account the time needed for the AutomatedSOS monitoring system to process new incoming data and detect the emergency, the Data4Help system to send the new data to AutomatedSOS and the average delay introduced from the communication interfaces.
\end{itemize}

The following performance requirements are additionally introduced, although with a minor importance compared to the previous one. They should anyway be met from the software, in order for it to be usable and efficient:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Data4Help Single Data Request Response}
	After a single data request is accepted, the system should send the requested data to the third party within 3 seconds. 
	
	\item \textbf{Data4Help Data Subscription Delay }
	When a new data is received from the system, the subscribed third parties should be notified of the new data within 2 seconds.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Constraints}
\subsubsection{Regulatory policies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{GDPR}: In order to protect the user's privacy and perform a correct data treatment, the system must be developed in compliance with the latest GDPR regulations, giving the maximum attention to the protection and anonymization of the user's data.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The only hardware limitations of our system is present in the devices on which AutomatedSOS and Track4Run applications will be installed. For this reason, the development of the software to be will have to reasonably take in account some common limitations of these devices, such as power consumption and memory size.


\subsection{Software System Attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}

The system must be available 24/7. Since this requirement is quite demanding, small service breaks will be tolerated. To boost reliability, a RAID architecture that combines multiple disk drives to have data redundancy is suggested. Using a RAID controller we could also expand disks' capacity or substitute them without the risk of losing data or suspending the service for too long. Preventive maintenance is also a good idea to avoid downtimes.

\subsubsection{Availability}

To guarantee a 3-nines (99.9\%) availability degree, a system of redundant servers could be considered. In this way we don't have a single point of failure and if one server fails, another one will be ready to substitute it.

\subsubsection{Security}

Security is a main issue.  At first, to access the functionalities offered by our platform, users have to complete a login phase providing their credentials: fiscal code and password in case of a single user or VAT code and electronic signature for the third parties. These sensitive information should be confidentially stored and encrypted using a proper hash function.

Secondly, the system  continuously collects data on health conditions from the users. Typically this kind of data are also considered sensitive and should be kept secret. Finally, also communications between users and our platform is very important, for this reason the system could be accessed by the customers using secure connection protocols like HTTPS to avoid Man In The Middle attacks. Only the system administrator who is responsible of the Web and Application Server configuration can decide if it is the case to implement them or not.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}

In order to make our software the most maintainable as possible, we will adopt a modular design for our code. In this different components of the system can be modified and additional ones can be introduced in the system with whenever is needed and with a minimal impact on the rest of the system.

Moreover, we will make sure to adopt standard design patterns and coding best practices, so that our code can be easily understood and modified by any future developer.

Finally, the code should be completely and properly documented in order to facilitate the understanding of it. 

\subsubsection{Portability}

During the system installation and setup, we have to consider different factors:

\begin{itemize}
\item Ease of installation on the central server
\item Scalability of the platform considering future adjustments without losing the already collected data
\item Portability of data between different machines, in order to move the system on several more powerful machines in case of necessity
up 24/7
\end{itemize}
