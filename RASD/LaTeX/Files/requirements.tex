\subsection{Scenarios}
\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
While talking, John tells his friend Matt about a new service called Data4Help that helps you keeping track of your health status. Frank, interested in checking his heart rate, downloads the app on his smartphone and fires it up. The app asks him to register to the service by filling a form with his personal information, including his fiscal code and a password of his choice that will be used as credentials for the login. 
After filling the form he clicks on the final checkbox to accept the personal data treatment policy.
Right after clicking on the "Submit" button, Frank receives a notification saying he successfully registered to Data4Help.
\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
Mary, a Data4Help customer, received for her birthday the new Eppol iClock. After the initial setting of the device, she decides to download the Data4Help application for her smartwatch. Once installed, she logs in with her accountand right after that, the "Device Management"

 view of the application appears. Mary taps on the iClock icon and by selecting "Heart Rate" from a dropdown she assigns the tracking of that paramater to her smartwatch. With the same procedure, she assigns to her smartphone the tracking of the "Position" parameter.
Finally, she clicks on the "Confirm" button and the app saves the settings and returns back to the home page.
\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
Steve, a Data4Help customer with diabete, needs to periodically check the glucose levels observed by his medical device connected with the Data4Help application on his smartphone. For doing this, he starts the Data4Help application and when the homepage shows up he  clicks on the "myData" tab. A nice view appears, containing all the information about his monitored health parameters with a lot of colorful diagrams. Steve filters out the displayed content by selecting the "Glucose Level" radio button on the top of the page and he changes the information granularity from "Week" to "Day" using a dropdown.  
\subsubsection{Scenario 4}
Michael Garcia, Boyer Pharmaceutical CEO, heard about the Data4Help service and in agreement with the Administrative Board, he decided to introduce it in the company. He visits  www.trackme.com/data4help and clicks on the "Business Solutions" section in order to register his company as a registered third party of the service. To do this, Michael fills in the registration form with all the requested information about the company, including the VAT-number, an e-mail and a password. After that he clicks on the "Submit" button and he immediately receives an e-mail with a link to complete the registration procedure.
\subsubsection{Scenario 5}
Brian, patient of the Lenox Private Medical Center, was released  yesterday. The clinic, registered to the Data4Help service, decides to monitor his health status to see if the treatment he was under reached the desired results.
The doctor that was in charge of Brian logs in to the Data4Help reserved page of the clinic. Once logged in, he inserts Brian's fiscal code and selects from a checkbox "Heart Beat" and "Temperature" as the data to monitor. Finally he chooses from a dropdown "3 months" as the observation period.
As soon as the doctor clicks on the "Send Request" button on the bottom of the page, Brian receives a notification on his smartphone. He launches the application and when the home page shows up he taps on the "Incoming Requests" tab. Here he sees the request coming from Lenox Private Medical Center. He briefly reads the description and he clicks on the "Accept" button. A confirmation e-mail, saying the patient accepted the treatment of his personal data, is immediately sent to Lenox Private Medical Center.
The doctor sees the e-mail and goes in the "Sent Requests" section of the Data4Help personal page of the company. After clicking on Brian's answer, all the requested data are displayed on screen.
\subsubsection{Scenario 6}
Pfuzer, a big pharmaceutical company registered to Data4Help service, needs to gather the heart rate data of all the italian young people under 30 years old for a market analysis aimed at evaluating the production of a new drug against heart disease. For this reason Todd Chavez, the marketing manager of the company, goes to the Pfuzer personal Data4Help page and once logged  in he clicks on the "Aggregated requests" tab in the home page. Once in the page he types in the textbox "Italy" as location, and selects the age range "<= 30" using a slider. Then he clicks on "Send request" on the bottom of the page and a warning message is immediately displayed on screen saying that the request cannot be satisfied. For this reason, Todd decides to untighten the search parameters. After changing them the constraints are satisfied and the requested data is immediately displayed on screen.
\subsubsection{Scenario 7}
Andrew decided to buy the new iClock as a gift for the birthday of his grandfather Leonard, 93 years old, who suffers from severe heart problems and lives alone. Since Leonard would like to be autonomous, his new device with AuotmatedSOS service active on it, grants him a safer life.

One night Leonard wakes up with severe chest pains. The iClock immediately detects the "heart rate" parameter exceeded the maximum threshold and shows a noisy emergency alert, saying that an ambulance will be called if the user doesn't abort in the following minute. Leonard is really sick and is not able to abort the operation. In few minutes an ambulance arrives and Leonard is immediately rescued.
\subsubsection{Scenario 8}
William suffers from epilepsy. The attacks are not very frequent but they are so strong that a few months ago he fell and he got a nasty head injury. While looking for an automated solution to check on his conditions, he hears about AutomatedSOS and decides to activate the service provided by Data4Help.

At first he sets the threshold of the tracked parameters with the help of his doctor and he adds the contacts of his parents. When the wristwatch detects repetitive shaking motion, it automatically sends the userâ€™s bluetooth-connected phone text and call alerts to the designated recipients. Within seconds, family members receive these alerts, which include the date, time and GPS location of the event.
\subsubsection{Scenario 9}
Virgin Active is organizing a run for all his customers. Luke, company's event manager, is thinking about using the Track4Run Service to accomplish this task. He logs into the company dedicated web page and he clicks on the Track4Run tab and then on "Create Run".

At this point a configuration frame shows up. Luke starts by filling out the "Basic info" section of the form: he adds the event name, an image, the location and the starting and ending time. Then he goes on by filling out the "Details" section in which he provides a short description of the event and the maximum number of participants. Finally, by clicking on a map, he marks all the checkpoints of the run.

After a quick check, Luke clicks on the "Create" button and a confirmation alert appears saying that the event has been successfully published in the news feed.
\subsubsection{Scenario 10}
Chris, runner and Data4Help customer, is looking for a run to join. By looking at the  news feed of Track4Run on his smartphone he sees the event created by Virgin Active. He taps on the event name and the full description of the event shows up. After reading the description and all the details he decides to join the run, hence he clicks on the "Participate" button. A confirmation alert shows up, saying that the event has been added to the attending events.
\subsubsection{Scenario 11}
Katy, Chris' wife and Data4Help customer,  wants to go cheer his husband at the run. The day of the run she launches the Data4Help application and in the Track4Run section she taps on the "Ongoing Runs" button. Katy selects the desired run and a nice map with a the GPS position of all the athletes opens up. In order to see the details of the husband she types in a textbox her husband name and press the "Filter" button.
